There has been a rapidly growing demand for low-cost, integrated single-shot spectrometers to be embedded in portable intelligent devices. Even though significant progress has been made in this area, two major problems are still remaining, namely the high temperature sensitivity and poor bandwidth-resolution ratio (BRR) that can’t meet the requirement of most applications. In this work, we present an integrated single-shot spectrometer relying on a silicon photonic circuit that has a footprint less than 3mm2, but could achieve broad operation bandwidth about 100 nm and high resolution up to 0.1 nm (with a BRR ~ 1000). Moreover, for the first time, we demonstrate an integrated spectrometer that could operate within a wide temperature range (between 10 and 70 degrees Celsius) without additional power consumption for temperature management.
